help Regions Overview

Regions in DS9

The tasks in this section of the Analysis menu utilize the Regions
program 'regcnts'.

1. Radial Profile Plot: run regcnts and pass results to the DS9 plotter.
Both source and background regions can be specified.

2. Counts in Regions: run regcnts and display textual output.
Both source and background regions can be specified.

Both of these tasks work off the original disk-based FITS file,
presenting results using WCS units, if the appropriate info is present
in the FITS header.

For situations where a disk file is not available (e.g., image data
generated by a program and sent to DS9's 'fits' XPA access point),
alternate versions of the radial profile and counts in regions tasks
are offered that work from DS9's internal image data. In these two
cases, results are presented in pixels. Aside from the units, the
results should be identical to the file-based results.

For more sophisticated analysis, please consider using the underlying
Regions tasks directly.
